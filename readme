Contains scripts that calculate frequency, clonal relatedness (similarity score) between different tumours in same patients, and frequency tables between pairs. It calculates this using the absolute copy number *segmentCN.txt files produced from TAPS 2.0, and accepts files produced from most platforms (ONCOSCAN, HUMANCYTOSNP etc.)

TAPS 2.0 can be found at http://patchwork.r-forge.r-project.org/.


To produce *segmentCN.txt
snp array raw files (illumina, affy etc.) -> NEXUS 7.5 SNP rank segmentation algorithm -> TAPS 2.0 -> SNParray_analysis repository 

Concordance_score_between_pairs_samples_using_break_points_and_copynumber.R - calculates a concordance score between different tumour subtypes in the same patients to identify which tumour subtypes are more similar to others. Combines both break points and absolute copy number.

Frequency_Table.R - calculates frequency table of copy number changes between two groups and gives p-value scores calculated from fisher's exact test.

Paired_Frequency_Table.R - calculates frequency table of copy number changes between pairs of samples and gives p-value scores calculated from fisher's exact test.
